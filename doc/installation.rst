Installing aiocoap
==================

In most situations, it is recommended to install the latest released version of
aiocoap. If you do not use a distribution that has aiocoap packaged, or if you
use Python's virtual environments, this is done with

::

    $ pip3 install --upgrade "aiocoap[all]"

If ``pip3`` is not available on your platform, you can manually download and
unpack the latest ``.tar.gz`` file from the `Python package index`_ and run

::

    $ ./setup.py install

Development version
-------------------

If you want to play with aiocoap's internals or consider contributing to the
project, the suggested way of operation is getting a Git checkout of the
project::

    $ git clone https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap

You can then use the project from that location, or install it with

::

    $ pip3 install --upgrade ".[all,docs]"

If you need to install the latest development version of aiocoap but do not
plan on editing (eg. because you were asked in the course of a bug report to
test something against the latest aiocoap version), you can install it directly
from the web::

    $ pip3 install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap#egg=aiocoap[all]"

With the ``-e`` option, that is also a viable option if you want to modify
aiocoap and pip's `choice of checkout directories`_ is suitable for you.
